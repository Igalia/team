# Skills

This application allows evaluating and analysing the expertise of a project team.

Teams that work in large areas of expertise sometimes come to point when they need to understand their capabilities.  This application addresses that need.

The whole area of expertise is divided into a set of sub-areas, or _skills_.  Each team member can then tell how good they feel themselves in each skill, and how much they would want to use that skill in their work.  After all members have assessed themselves, it is possible to see expertise of the team as a whole: which skills are represented better or worse, which skills are more or less interesting to the people, and in which areas there is room for improvement.

Additionally, projects that the team works on or is interested in are assessed the similar way, using the same set of skills: for each project, the team identifies a selection of skills that the project focuses on.  This way the team builds knowledge on what the market requires in their field, and can then decide if its expertise matches the market demand.

The application supports multiple teams (see [People](../people/README.md) application), and allows different teams to have different sets of skills.
